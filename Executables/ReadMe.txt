Welcome to the Schieber Jass Application developed as a student project at the NTB Buchs

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use "Schieber.jar" to start Client and Server on your local PC. You can add Bots directly via the GUI and therefore play a single player game.
Alternatively anyone (human or KI player) can connect to your PC while the lobby is open, just tell them the IP address or name of your PC.

The folder "Standalone Bot" contains "Bot.bat" which is used to start a Bot which will automatically try to connect to a set server. Please directly specify the server settings in the "Bot.bat" file.
